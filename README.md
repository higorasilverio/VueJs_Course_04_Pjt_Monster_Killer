# VueJs_Course_04_Pjt_Monster_Killer

This is a simple game where a Hero must defeat a Monster, using simple and special attacks to do so. He can also heal himself, what doesn't prevent the Monster attack.

The program itself, uses a HTML page with buttons, to perform the actions, and divs to show progress and action messages.

All of its design is made with a simple CSS file, which edits the HTML tags classes.

The main processing is made by using JavaScript with Vue.JS framework, in a separated file too.
